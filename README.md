## Description

This is a completely inert module that does nothing.

## Setup

### What inert affects

This module does nothing, so it affects nothing.

This is due to the transitive property of nothing.

### Setup Requirements

There are no requirements to do nothing.

### Beginning with inert

The `inert` module doesn't do anything, so in effect you already started using
it while reading this sentence.  Great job!  It's probably time to get back to
work, though.

## Usage

You shouldn't use it, because it's useless.

## Reference

See [REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/poxvupuli/puppet-inert/blob/master/REFERENCE.md)

## Limitations

The module does nothing, so in a sense its limitations are infinite.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.
