## Description

This is a completely inert module that does nothing.

## Setup

### What inert affects

This module does nothing, so it affects nothing.

This is due to the transitive property of nothing.

### Setup Requirements

There are no requirements to do nothing.

### Beginning with inert

The `inert` module doesn't do anything, so in a sense you've already been using
while reading this sentence.  Great job!  It's probably time you got back to
work, though.

## Usage

You shouldn't use it, because it's useless.

## Reference

Here, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers,
facts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus
the name "Reference") to find specific details; most users don't read it per
se.

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there
are Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel
are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
